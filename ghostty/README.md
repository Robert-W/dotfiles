# Ghostty

## Requirements
- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh)

## Brew packages
- `brew install ghostty`

## Fonts
Ghostty comes with several fonts, but this configuration uses a Nerd font
version of Operator Mono. Install it onto your system from the `../fonts`
directory and Ghostty should be able to pick it up.

## Link configuration files
